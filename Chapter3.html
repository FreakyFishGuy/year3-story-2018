	Only death can pay for life.
	And there came a second crack, loud and sharp as thunder, and the smoke stirred and whirled around her and the pyre shifted, the logs exploding as the fire 
	touched  their secret hearts. She heard the screams of frieghtened horses and the voices of the dothraki raised in shouts of fear and terror, and Ser jorah calling
	her name and cursing. No, she wanted to shout to him, No, my good knight,do not fear for me, the fire is mine. iam Daenerys Stormborn , duaghter of dragons
	bride of dragons , mother of dragons, Don't  you see!, Don't you SEE?.

<p>  
	With a belch of flame and smoke that reached thirty feat into the sky, The pyre collapsed and came down around her. Unafraid, Dany stepped  forward into the firestorm 
	,calling to her children. The third crack was as loud and sharp as the breaking of the world. When the fire died at last and the ground became cool enough to walk upon 
	, Ser jorah Mormont found her amidst the ashes,  surrounded by blackened logs and bits of glowing ember and the burnt bones of man and women and stallion.
	She was naked , covered in ash and soot, her clothes burnt and her beautiful her all crisped away, yet she was unhurt. She crounched down near the ground protecting her children.

	Cradeled in her arms were three beautiful baby dragons, suddenly as Daenerys rose to her feet her black dragon hissed, pale smoke venting from its mouth and nostrils. The other two pulled away from 
	her and added their voices to the call, Transluacent wings unfolding and stirring in the air, and for the first time in huhndreds of years the night came alive with 
	the music of dragons.
