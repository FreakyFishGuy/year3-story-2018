<h3>Perspective Tyrion Lannister<h3>

<p>
   Tyrions story takes place as he contemplates his journey on the road with the lannister amry.

   "The have my son tywin lannister said"."The do my lord". The messenger's voice was dulled  by exaustion. On the breast of his torn surecoat, 
	The brindled boar of crackehall was half obscured by dried blood.

	One of your sons,Tyrion thought. He took a sip of wine and said not a word, Thinking of jaime. When he lifted his arm, pain shot
	through his elbow, reminding him of his own brief taste of battle. He loved his brother but he would not have wanted to be with him in 
	the whispering wood for all the gold in clasterly rock.

<p>
   His lord fathers's assembled captians and bannermen had falen very quiet as the courier told his tale. The only sound was the crackle and his of a log burning in the hearth at the end of 
   the long drafy common room. After the Hardships of the long relenetless drive south, the prospect of a single night in an inn had cheered tyrion mightily... though he had wished it had not been this in again,
   with all its memories. His father had set a grueling pace and it had taken it's toll. Men wounded in beveetle kept up as best they could or were abandoned to fend for themselves

<p>
  Every morning they left a few more men by the wayside, men who went to sleep only never to wake. Every morning a few more men collapsed along the way.
  Every Evening a few more deserted, stealing into the darkness. Tyrion had been half tempted to go with them.
