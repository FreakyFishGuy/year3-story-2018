<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<h3>Perspective Jon Snow<h3>
<p>
	Jons story takes place with jon and sam arguing over whether jon should leave for beyond the wall.

</p>

<p>
	The mare wickered softly as jon snow tightened the cinch. "Easy Sweet lady", he said in a soft voice, quieting her with a with a touch. Wind whispered through the stable
	a cold dead breath on his face, but jon paid it no mind. He strapped his ro;; to the saddle, his scarred fingers stiff and clumsey. "Ghost". He called softly, "To me ".
	And the wolf was there, eyes like embers. "Jon Please you ust not do this".
</p>

<p>  
	He mounted, the riens in his hand, and wheeled the horse around to face the night. Samwell tarley stood in the table , a full moon peering over his shoulder.he through a giants shadow 
	immense and bllack. "Get out of my way sam". "Jon you can't", sam said. "I wont let you". "I would sooner not hurt ", jon told him "Move aside Sam or I'll ride you down".
</p>

<p>
	"You won't. You have to listen to me please....." , Jon put his spurs to horse flesh, and the  mare bolted for the door. For an instant, Sam stood his gorund, his face round and pale as the 
	moon behind him, His mouth a widening O of surprise. At the last moment , when they were almost on him , he jumped aside as Jon had know he would , stumnled and fell.
	The mare lept over him and out into the night.
