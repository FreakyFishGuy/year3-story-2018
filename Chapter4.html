	Uttered by mirri maz durr  as a second crack echoed, lound and as sharp as thunder, and as the smoke stirred and whirled around her as the pyre shifted. Their were logs exploding 
	as the fire touched the sacred hearts. Daenerys  heard screams of the frieghtened horses and the voices of dothraki raised in screams of fear and terror, Ser jorah calling her name and

	With the be;ch of flame and smoke that reached thirty feat into the sky, The pyre collapsed and came down around Daenerys. Afraid to move dany was frozen still be the sheer size of the flames 
	which was swirling into a massive firestorm. Dany  could feel the fire getting closer and closer to her and was afraid this was the end for her and she may not get to see 
	her children. Daenerys let out screams of pain as the firestorm consumed her as it consumed all around it, Ser jorah rushed to danys aid as soon as he heard the scrweam but as 
	he got theere the screams stopped. Ser jorah found Daenerys admist the ashes she was surrounded by logs and bits of glowing ember her body was burnt to a crisp and all that 
	reamained was the pose she was in before she died.

	Cradeled in her arms were three baby dragons, They  let out hisses and roars of pain as the morned the death of their mother. Transluacent wings unfolding and 
	stirring in the air, and for the first time in huhndreds of years the night came alive with the music of dragons. And Mirri Maz Durr repeated what she said before
	"death can pay for life".
